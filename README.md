# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

## Who am I?

I am Alex Marinescu, and I am an ever-growing fullstack developer. I'm a dedicated and calm person who enjoys challanges and puzzles.
Started out with forensic science & chemistry -> somehow ended up studying mathematics -> then switched to informatics and now I'm having my master's degree in AI. 
It's been an interesting journey.

## What will you find here?

You will find some of my personal and team projects. I've created and teamed-up for these projects to practice and improve my skills, but later
down the line, you may see some practical applications as well.

All the code and resources here are free to use. If you have any feedback, questions or suggestions, or you need any private resources to run some
of the applications, don't hesitate to contact me.
